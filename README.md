# Cogs106 Final Project: Simulate & Recover 


## Introduction
The purpose of the Simulate-and-Recover exercise is to evaluate the accuaracy at which the EZ Diffusion Model can estimate parameters from simulated response time (RT) data. This process allows us to test a model's ability to recover the paramaeters 
from the data it generates itself. By using different sample sizes while repeatedly simulating the data, we are can assess the model;s overall performance and sensitivity to noise.
